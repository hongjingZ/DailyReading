# GAN Survey(Image Synthesis)

[1] 《An Introduction to Image Synthesis with Generative Adversarial Nets》

He Huang, Phillip S. Yu and Changhu Wang

Abstract:  There has been a drastic growth of research in Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) in the past few years. Proposed in 2014, GAN has been applied to various applications such as computer vision and natural language processing, and achieves impressive performance. Among the many applications of GAN, image synthesis is the most well-studied one, and research in this area has already demonstrated the great potential of using GAN in image synthesis. In this paper, we provide a taxonomy of methods used in image synthesis, review different models for text-to-image synthesis and image-to-image translation, and discuss some evaluation metrics as well as possible future research directions in image synthesis with GAN.

This is a good survey paper, I will go through all the recent works within the paper.
