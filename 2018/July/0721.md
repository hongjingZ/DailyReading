Abstract: This paper learns a graphical model, namely an explanatory graph, which reveals the knowledge hierarchy hidden inside a pre-trained CNN. Considering that each filter in a conv-layer of a pre-trained CNN usually represents a mixture of object parts, we propose a simple yet efficient method to automatically disentangles different part patterns from each filter, and construct an explanatory graph. In the explanatory graph, each node represents a part pattern, and each edge encodes co-activation relationships and spatial relationships between patterns. More importantly, we learn the explanatory graph for a pre-trained CNN in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without a need of annotating object parts. Experiments show that each graph node consistently represents the same object part through different images. We transfer part patterns in the explanatory graph to the task of part localization, and our method significantly outperforms other approaches.

Introduction of an explanatory graph:

1. The explanatory graph has multiple layers. Each layer corresponds to a conv-layer in the CNN.
2. Each node in the explanatory graph represents a specific part pattern. We disentangle object-part components from features of each filter. Thus, we may learn multiple nodes from a single filter.
3. Each edge in the explanatory graph models the co-activation relationship and the deformable spatial relationship between nodes.
4. A node in a high layer represents a large part, while its connected nodes in the lower layer describe sub-regions of the part.
5. We can consider the explanatory graph as compression of middle-layer features in a CNN. We use thousands of graph nodes to represent information encoded in millions of neural units in middle conv-layers. Given an input image, its feature maps of conv-layers can only trigger a limited number of graph nodes.
