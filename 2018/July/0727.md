Abstract: We investigate conditional adversarial networks as a general-purpose solution to image-to-image translation problems. These networks not only learn the mapping from input image to output image, but also learn a loss function to train this mapping. This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.

Network Structure:

Loss function design:G∗ = arg minGmaxD  LcGAN (G, D) + λLL1(G).

LcGAN (G, D) =Ex,y[log D(x, y)]+ Ex,z[log(1 − D(x, G(x, z))]

LL1(G) = Ex,y,z[|y − G(x, z)|]

My thoughts: I've seen the work using convolutional neural networks to transfer the art style of images. But pix2pix provides us a new way to do image-to-image translations. The network structure is similar with cGAN, the paired pictures here can be treated as the label in cGAN. The L1 loss constraints restrict the generated images to be similar with the paired images, which yields more sharp results. Instead of simply using the encoder-decoder, they found using skip connection such as U-Net can preserve lot's of lower level features from X to G(x, z). At last they used patchGAN's discriminator, instead of classifying the whole image, it tries to classify each N × N path of the image and average all the scores of patches to get the final score for the image. From experiments they have found that set N=70 yields good pictures and also high FCN-scores. The weakness of this model is the strong assumption of the input data, which requires the data to be occured in pair form, some times it's hard to get a same picture in different conditions.
