Abstract: Learning of classification models in practice often relies on nontrivial human annotation effort in which humans assign class labels to data instances. As this process can be very time consuming and costly, finding effective ways to reduce the annotation cost becomes critical for building such models. In this work we solve this problem by exploring a new approach that actively learns classification models from groups, which are subpopulations of instances, and human feedback on the groups. Each group is labeled with a number in [0,1] interval representing a human estimate of the proportion of instances with one of the class labels in this subpopulation. To form the groups to be annotated, we develop a hierarchical active learning framework that divides the whole population into smaller subpopulations, which allows us to gradually learn more refined models from the subpopulations and their class proportion labels. Our extensive experiments on numerous data sets show that our method is competitive and outperforms existing approaches for reducing the human annotation cost.

My thoughts: This paper use hierarchical clustering method and alternate methods to derive hypercube-like groups of data(they wish the hypercube-like group has high purity and representative). Instead of labeling each instance in traditional active learning query setting, this algorithm takes group proportional label and assign the exact label for each instance within the group based on model's confidence. Moreover, this paper uses maximal expected model change strategy to select group of instances to query. They demonstrate from experiments that this strategy can bring fast convergence and select informative instances within these groups. I'd like to see more detail in experiments parts, like what classifier they choose, what kind of hierarchical clustering method is used. Since this is a tree shape(top-down) learning method, maybe it's better to illustrate the learning process in a flowing graph.
